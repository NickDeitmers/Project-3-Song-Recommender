# Project-3-Song-Recommender

Dear TA,

Hereby my third project: Song Recommender. I do have something which I do not really know how to do:
  How could I create a csv file filled with the songs of the spotify playlist, and use this file in my code to, create clusters and extract the information for a recommended song?

  Right now I have one cell of code which reads the complete playlist directly from the Spotify API, but this cell takes about 1 hour to complete...

Let me know if you could help me out!
